Here is a README description for the Personal Fitness Tracker application, formatted for GitHub.

🏋️ Personal Fitness Tracker
This is a personal fitness tracking application built with Python, using the Streamlit library for the interactive frontend and PostgreSQL as the backend database. The application allows a single user to log workouts, set fitness goals, and connect with friends to view a dynamic leaderboard.

The project is structured according to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) principles to ensure the codebase is clean, modular, and easy to maintain.

🌟 Features
User Management: Create, update, and delete your personal fitness profile.

Workout & Exercise Tracking: Log your daily workouts and detailed exercises, including reps, sets, and weight lifted.

Goal Management: Set personal fitness goals and track their completion status.

Social Connections: Add friends and see how you stack up against them on a dynamic leaderboard.

Business Insights: Gain valuable insights into your fitness journey with key metrics like total workout time, average duration, and total weight lifted, powered by SQL aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).
